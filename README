To build:
git clone https://github.com/gartung/dockerfiles.git
cd dockerfiles/slc6-prereq-cvmfs
docker build -t slc6-prereq-cvmfs .

To run in ssh mode and connect via ssh:
docker run --privileged -d -P  -v /tmp:/tmp slc6-prereq-cvmfs
(this should give container number)
docker port <container number or name>
(gives the container port for ssh)
ssh -p<container port> cms_admin@0.0.0.0
or ssh -p<container port> cma_admin@172.17.0.1 (the docker private network head IP address)
setup CMSSW out of /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch
(password is cms_admin)
(su password is root_password)

If you use Xquartz 2.7.9 on OSX and you want to use cmsShow with OpenGL support 
you will need to copy startx to 
/usr/X11/bin/startx
This adds  the option -iglx to the Xserver start command..
